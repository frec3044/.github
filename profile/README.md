## Materials for FREC 3044: Environmental Data Science

This is a junior-level undergraduate course at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu), Blacksburg, VA. It is designed as a required class for the [Environmental Data Science major](https://www.vt.edu/academics/majors/environmental-data-science.html) and an optional course for the [Computational Modeling and Data Analytics](https://data.science.vt.edu/programs/cmda.html) major.  Students are expected to have prior experience with R programing. 

The materials are developed by [Dr. Quinn Thomas](https://rquinnthomas.com) and build on materials developed by many others (see acknowledgments in the specific models)

Each repository is a module in the course.  Using [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com), students fork the repository into private repositories that exist in a course-specific organization. 

The materials are open-education materials that are available through an MIT or CC-BY license. 

### Modules

### Currently used

1. `git-rmd-intro`: a module that helps students get set up with GitHub, Git, and Quarto.
2. `tidyverse-intro`: a module that introduces/reviews basic data science components through tidyverse functions.  Uses tabular data on reservoir water quality in southwest Virginia.
3. `climate-change`: plotting.  Uses NOAA and NASA data on global temperature and atmospheric CO2
4. `lake-ice`: regression, modeling, and reading Excel files. It uses measurements of ice cover at a lake.
5. `water-quality`: functions, iteration, APIs.  Uses USGS river water quality data.
6. `land-carbon`: joining tables, databases.  Uses NEON forest inventory data.
7. `machine-learning`: machine learning with tidymodels package.  Uses NEON forest carbon data.
8. `environmental-justice`: geospatial analysis with raster cubes and polygons.  Uses remotely sensed NDVI and maps of historical redlining.
9. `dashboard-lake-ice`: dashboards and review of other module skills.  It uses global measurements of ice cover.

### Previously used

10. `eco-forecast`: ecological forecasting.  Designed around a set of [Macrosystems EDDIE modules](https://serc.carleton.edu/eddie/macrosystems/modules).
